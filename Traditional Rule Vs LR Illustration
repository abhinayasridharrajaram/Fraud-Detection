#Logistic Regression the old way


# Step 1: split the features and labels into train and test data 
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Step 2: Define which model to use 
model = LinearRegression()

# Step 3: Fit the model to the training data
 model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Obtain model predictions from the test data 
y_predicted = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 5: Compare y_test to predictions and obtain performance metrics (r^2 score) 
r2_score(y_test, y_predicted)
