3 We see that the model results don't improve drastically. 
# We now have few less false positives, but  18 false negatives, i.e. cases of fraud we are not catching. 
#If we mostly care about catching fraud, and not so much about the false positives, this does actually not improve our model at all, albeit a simple option to try
# Define the model with balanced subsample
model = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced_subsample', random_state=5)

# Fit your training model to your training set
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Obtain the predicted values and probabilities from the model 
predicted = model.predict(X_test)
probs = model.predict_proba(X_test)

# Print the roc_auc_score, the classification report and confusion matrix
print (roc_auc_score(y_test, probs[:,1]))
print (classification_report(y_test, predicted))
print (confusion_matrix(y_test, predicted))
